<strong>This is a PWA developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript</strong> to calculate operations with some extra features. It has offline functionality so you are able to use it without an internet connection, but keep in mind that only works properly with Google Chrome and it should be mentioned that there is a background functionality, but it is only available on PC and tablet, you can find the different layouts on the settings. Certain functions have been implemented using <a href="https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode">HTML5-QRCode</a> and <a href="https://www.exchangerate-api.com/">Exchange Rate API</a>. 

Get rid of your boring old calculator and enhance your math operations, through a fully customizable experience with a ton of extra utilities.

Unlock your artistic side being completely creative without limitations. Hide items or buttons you don't like by using the same colours, express yourself, and share your themes with friends.

Although this is not an entirely scientific calculator, you can make any operation you want and use some features and buttons that you expect on your daily life. Most of them can be used with a keyboard, mouse or touching the screen and <strong>they are divided into four broad categories:</strong>
